### Set Up Linters
## Define Linters
A linter is a tool to help you improve your code. You can learn more about Linters here: (source: (<https://www.testim.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-heres-a-definition-and-quick-start-guide/>)).

Advantages of Linting:

1. Fewer errors in production- The use of linters helps to diagnose and fix technical issues such as code smells. As a result, fewer defects make their way to production.
2. Achieving a more readable and consistent style, through the enforcement of its rules.
3. Having more secure and performant code.
4. Having an objective and measurable assessment of code quality.
5. Having fewer discussions about code style and aesthetic choices during code reviews.

## Install Linters 
You can find linters for most of the programming languages, e.g. Rubocop for Ruby or ESLint for JavaScript.

Also, there are many ways you can integrate a linter in your workflow:

-text editor plugin
-GitHub Actions
-GitHub apps

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- **[Question_1]**
What is a medium-fidelity wireframe?

  - Medium-fidelity wireframes present how your website's elements should be arranged, but they skip detailed information about aesthetics (e.g., colors, images). They can assist with communicating to teams how aesthetic features can support essential functionalities. Please read <a href="https://mentormate.com/blog/low-fidelity-wireframes-vs-high-fidelity-wireframes/" >Low Fidelity Wireframes vs High Fidelity Wireframes </a> to fully understand the difference between low-, medium-, and high-fidelity wireframes.

- **[Question_2]**
Where can I download node JS for installation?

  - Node Js can be downloaded here- <ul>
    <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"> Node JS </a></li>
  </ul>
